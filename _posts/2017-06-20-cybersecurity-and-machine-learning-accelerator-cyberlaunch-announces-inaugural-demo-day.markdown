About CyberLaunch 

CyberLaunch is the leading accelerator for information security and machine learning startups. Twice a year we invest in a select number of startups (up to $100k per startup). The startups move to Atlanta for 3 months, during which we work intensively with them to get the company into the best possible shape to acquire customers and to refine their pitch to investors. Each cycle culminates in Demo Day, when the startups present their companies to a carefully selected, invite-only audience. But CyberLaunch doesn’t end on Demo Day; we continue to help founders for the life of their company, and beyond.
